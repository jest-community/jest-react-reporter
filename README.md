[![Actions Status](https://github.com/jest-community/jest-react-reporter/workflows/Unit%20tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jest-community/jest-react-reporter/actions)

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn add --dev jest-react-reporter
```

## Usage

Register the reporter with Jest following the docs:
https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration#reporters-array-modulename-modulename-options

Note that this is still early days and this reporter is quite experimental.
We're aiming for feature parity with Jest's builtin reporters as a start, but
we're hoping to add more features in the future. Please open issues (preferably
PRs!) for any bugs.
